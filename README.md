# handwritten_digits_recognition-
 This project uses the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm to recognize handwritten digits from the scikit-learn Digits dataset, consisting of 8x8 pixel images representing digits 0-9. The images are flattened into 64 features, and the model is trained to classify the digits. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, and a confusion matrix.


Hereâ€™s a more detailed description for your Handwritten Digit Recognition Project:

Handwritten Digit Recognition Using k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
This project focuses on building a machine learning model that recognizes handwritten digits using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. The model is trained and tested on the Digits dataset provided by scikit-learn, which consists of 1,797 grayscale images of handwritten digits, each represented as an 8x8 pixel grid. The pixel values, ranging from 0 to 16, are flattened into 64 features for each image.

The goal of the project is to classify these images into one of ten classes, representing the digits 0 through 9. After preprocessing the data, the k-NN model is trained using a portion of the dataset, and its performance is evaluated on unseen data. Key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix are used to assess the model's effectiveness.

In addition to training the model, the project includes visualizations of the digit images, both before training and after prediction, to provide a better understanding of the data and the model's output.
