# handwritten_digits_recognition-
 This project uses the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm to recognize handwritten digits from the scikit-learn Digits dataset, consisting of 8x8 pixel images representing digits 0-9. The images are flattened into 64 features, and the model is trained to classify the digits. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, and a confusion matrix.
